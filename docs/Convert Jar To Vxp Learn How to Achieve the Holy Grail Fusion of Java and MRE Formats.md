JAR files are Java ARchive files that contain Java programs or libraries. VXP files are Mediatek MRE (Mobile Runtime Environment) applications that run on some feature phones. If you want to convert JAR files to VXP files, you will need to use a tool called VxPatch.
 
VxPatch is a web-based service that can patch VXP files with the correct IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) number of your phone. This is necessary because some VXP applications check the IMSI number of the phone before running, and if it does not match, they will not work.

Here are the steps to convert JAR files to VXP files using VxPatch:
 
1. Download the JAR file you want to convert and rename it to .zip. Extract the contents of the zip file to a folder.
2. Find the .class file that contains the main method of the Java program. You can use a tool like JD-GUI to decompile the .class file and see the source code.
3. Download a VXP file that has a similar functionality or interface as the JAR file you want to convert. You can find some VXP files here: https://www.vxpstore.com/
4. Rename the VXP file to .zip and extract the contents of the zip file to another folder.
5. Replace the .mre file in the VXP folder with the .class file from the JAR folder. Make sure they have the same name.
6. Compress the contents of the VXP folder back to a zip file and rename it to .vxp.
7. Find out your phone's IMSI number by dialing \*#06# on your phone and noting down the 15-digit number.
8. Go to https://vxpatch.luxferre.top/ and input your IMSI number with a 9 at the beginning. Then select your VXP file, click 'Patch' and you should be able to download a patched version.
9. Transfer the patched VXP file to your phone and run it. Enjoy!

Note: This method may not work for all JAR files and VXP files, as they may have different requirements or dependencies. Use it at your own risk.
