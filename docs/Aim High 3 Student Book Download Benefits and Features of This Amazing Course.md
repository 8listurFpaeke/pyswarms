Aim High is a six-level course for teenagers that aims to develop language learning through carefully chosen vocabulary, interesting texts, and essential study skills. The level 3 student's book is suitable for intermediate learners who want to improve their grammar, vocabulary, and exam success. In this article, we will review some of the features and benefits of this book.
 
## What's inside the book?
 
The book consists of 12 units, each covering a different topic such as sports, music, travel, and technology.

The Language Focus section teaches grammar points through clear explanations and examples, followed by practice exercises. The Vocabulary Builder section introduces new words and expressions related to the topic of the unit, using texts, pictures, and activities. The Reading and Writing Skills section develops reading comprehension and writing skills through engaging texts and tasks. The Speaking and Listening Skills section provides opportunities for speaking and listening practice through dialogues, role-plays, and recordings.
 
## What are the benefits of the book?
 
One of the main benefits of the book is that it uses vocabulary from the Oxford 3000â¢, a list of the most important words to know in English. This helps learners to expand their vocabulary and use it confidently in different contexts. The book also teaches idioms, expressions, phrasal verbs, and other aspects of vocabulary that enrich communication.

Another benefit of the book is that it teaches essential study skills and learning strategies that help learners become more independent and effective language learners. For example, the book shows how to use dictionaries, how to organize information, how to check spelling and punctuation, how to give opinions and arguments, and how to prepare for exams.
 
A third benefit of the book is that it offers a variety of digital materials that enhance learning and save time for teachers and students.

There is also an Online Practice (available at levels 1-5) that provides extra homework activities that can be automatically marked and tracked by teachers. There is also a Classroom Presentation Tool that brings easy-to-use digital features to the front of the classroom for heads-up lessons.
