## Why You Should Play Age of Mythology: The Titans
 
If you enjoyed Age of Mythology, you will love The Titans expansion pack. Not only does it add a new civilization with its own unique units, gods, and powers, but it also enhances the gameplay with new features and improvements. Here are some of the reasons why you should play Age of Mythology: The Titans:

- You can unleash the titans. These are huge creatures that can turn the tide of any battle with their devastating attacks and high durability. Each civilization has its own titan, such as the fire-breathing Cerberus for the Greeks or the winged Chimaera for the Atlanteans. You can summon a titan once you reach the final age and build a special temple. However, be careful, as your enemies can also summon their own titans and challenge yours.
- You can explore a new campaign. The Titans features a 12-mission campaign that follows the story of Kastor, the son of Arkantos, who leads the Atlanteans in a quest to restore their lost power. Along the way, he will face new enemies, such as the traitorous god Kronos and his followers, as well as old allies, such as Ajax and Amanra. The campaign is full of twists and turns, as well as cinematic cutscenes that enhance the narrative.
- You can try new strategies. The Atlantean civilization is different from the other three in many ways. For example, they do not have specific gatherers for each resource, but instead use citizens who can gather any resource and build any structure. They also do not pay favor to their gods, but instead generate it automatically by building town centers and temples. They can also upgrade any human unit to a hero, giving them more power and resistance against myth units. These features make the Atlanteans versatile and adaptable to any situation.
- You can enjoy improved graphics and sound. The Titans looks as good as Age of Mythology before it, which looked superb for its time. The game still looks great overall, though not quite as impressive as it used to, now that it's been surpassed by newer games[^2^]. However, the expansion pack adds some graphical enhancements, such as improved water effects, more detailed textures, and more animations for the units and buildings. The sound is also excellent, with a fitting soundtrack that changes according to the mood of the game and voice acting that brings the characters to life.

Age of Mythology: The Titans is a worthy expansion pack for one of the best real-time strategy games ever made. It offers more content, more variety, and more fun for fans of the genre. If you want to experience a game that combines mythology, history, and fantasy in an epic way, you should definitely give it a try.
