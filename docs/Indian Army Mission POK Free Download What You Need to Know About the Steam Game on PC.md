Some quotes from the developer and the users are:

> "I wanted to make a game that would honor the Indian army and their sacrifices for the country. I also wanted to show the beauty and culture of Kashmir, which is often neglected or misrepresented in the media. I hope the game will inspire the players to learn more about the history and geography of India and Kashmir." - Herron Wask, developer of Indian Army - Mission POK

> "This game is amazing. The graphics are stunning and the gameplay is smooth and realistic. The missions are challenging and fun. The game makes me feel proud to be an Indian and a fan of the Indian army. I recommend this game to anyone who loves shooting games and patriotic themes." - Rajesh Kumar, user review on Steam

> "This game is a waste of money and time. The game is full of bugs and glitches. The game crashes frequently and the controls are unresponsive. The game is also very offensive and insensitive to the people of Kashmir and Pakistan. The game promotes hatred and violence. I regret buying this game and I wish I could get a refund." - Ali Raza, user review on Steam
