# How to Play Sims Lebensgeschichten Without a CD: A Step-by-Step Guide
 
Sims Lebensgeschichten (Sims Life Stories) is a spin-off of the popular Sims series that lets you create and control your own characters and their stories. However, if you want to play the game without having to insert the CD every time, you might need a nocd crack. A nocd crack is a modified version of the game's executable file that bypasses the CD check and allows you to run the game without the disc. In this article, we will show you how to download and install a nocd crack for Sims Lebensgeschichten and enjoy the game without any hassle.

## Step 1: Backup Your Original Game Files
 
Before you apply any nocd crack, it is always advisable to backup your original game files in case something goes wrong. To do this, simply copy the folder where you installed Sims Lebensgeschichten (usually C:\Program Files\EA Games\Sims Lebensgeschichten) and paste it somewhere else on your computer. You can also rename the folder to something like "Sims Lebensgeschichten Original" to avoid confusion.
 
## Step 2: Download a Nocd Crack for Sims Lebensgeschichten
 
There are many websites that offer nocd cracks for various games, but not all of them are safe or reliable. Some of them might contain viruses, malware, or unwanted software that can harm your computer or compromise your privacy. Therefore, you should always use a trusted source and scan any file you download with an antivirus program before opening it. One of the websites that we recommend for downloading nocd cracks is GameCopyWorld (https://www.gamecopyworld.com/). This website has a large collection of nocd cracks for various games, including Sims Lebensgeschichten. To download a nocd crack for Sims Lebensgeschichten from GameCopyWorld, follow these steps:
 
- Go to https://www.gamecopyworld.com/ and search for "Sims Lebensgeschichten" in the search box.
- Click on the link that says "Sims: Life Stories / Die Sims: Lebensgeschichten [MULTI16] No-DVD/Fixed Image".
- Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the link that says "Download".
- You will be redirected to another page where you will see a list of mirrors. Choose one of them and click on it.
- You will be asked to enter a captcha code to verify that you are not a robot. Enter the code and click on "Submit".
- You will see a download button. Click on it and save the file to your computer.

The file you downloaded is a compressed archive that contains the nocd crack. You will need a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract it.
 
## Step 3: Install the Nocd Crack for Sims Lebensgeschichten
 
Once you have extracted the file, you will see two folders: "Crack" and "Mini-Image". The "Crack" folder contains a modified version of the game's executable file (SimsLS.exe) that bypasses the CD check. The "Mini-Image" folder contains a small image file (SLS.mds) that emulates the CD. You can use either one of them to play the game without the CD, but we recommend using the mini-image as it is more compatible and less likely to cause errors. To install the nocd crack for Sims Lebensgeschichten using the mini-image, follow these steps:

- Open the folder where you installed Sims Lebensgeschichten (usually C:\Program Files\EA Games\Sims Lebensgeschichten).
- Copy the file SLS.mds from the "Mini-Image" folder and paste it in the same folder where you installed Sims Lebensgeschichten.
- Download and install a program called Daemon Tools Lite (https://www.daemon-tools.cc/products/dtLite). This program allows you to mount image files as virtual drives on your computer.
- Run Daemon Tools Lite and click on the icon that looks like a lightning bolt.
- Select "Virtual Devices" and then "Add SCSI".
- A new virtual drive will appear on your
