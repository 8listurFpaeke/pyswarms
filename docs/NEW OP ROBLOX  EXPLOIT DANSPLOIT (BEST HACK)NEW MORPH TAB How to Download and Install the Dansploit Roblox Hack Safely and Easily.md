## The Plot
 
The film begins with Raj Chaudhary (Vatsal Sheth), a young engineering student who lives with his widowed mother (Farida Jalal) and his younger sister. Raj's father, Deven Chaudhary (Ajay Devgn), was a famous car designer who was killed by his business partners - Rakesh Kapoor (Pankaj Dheer), Raj Chopra (Sadashiv Amrapurkar) and Inspector Khurana (Shakti Kapoor) - when he refused to sell them his revolutionary design of a car that can run on water.
 
On his birthday, Raj receives a gift from his father's lawyer - a car that his father had designed and built before his death. Raj is overjoyed to see the car and decides to name it Taarzan. He takes the car to a garage owned by his friend Priya (Ayesha Takia), who is also his love interest. Priya's father (Amrish Puri) is a retired army officer who supports Raj and his family.
 
Raj and Priya work on restoring the car and soon discover that it has some amazing features, such as voice control, bulletproof body, speed boost and self-repair. They also realise that the car has a soul and can communicate with them through the radio. The car reveals that it was Deven's spirit that brought it to life and that it wants to avenge his death.
 
Meanwhile, Rakesh, Raj and Khurana are still looking for Deven's design and learn about Raj's car. They try to steal it or destroy it, but Taarzan always manages to escape or fight back. Taarzan also helps Raj and Priya in their personal and professional lives, such as saving them from goons, helping them win a car race and getting them admission in a prestigious college.
 
However, things take a dark turn when Taarzan starts killing Deven's murderers one by one in gruesome ways. Raj tries to stop Taarzan from becoming a killing machine, but Taarzan refuses to listen.
