# Discrete Mathematical Structures with Applications to Computer Science by J.P. Tremblay and R. Manohar
 
This is a book review of **Discrete Mathematical Structures with Applications to Computer Science** by J.P. Tremblay and R. Manohar, published by McGraw-Hill in 1975[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. This book is intended for undergraduate students of computer science who want to learn the fundamentals of discrete mathematics and its applications to various topics such as logic, set theory, algorithms, graphs, languages, automata, and cryptography.
 
The book consists of 14 chapters and covers a wide range of discrete mathematical concepts and techniques. The authors explain the concepts in a clear and rigorous manner, using examples, exercises, and proofs to illustrate the main points. The book also provides many applications of discrete mathematics to computer science problems, such as designing circuits, testing programs, parsing languages, and encrypting messages.

- It is outdated and does not reflect the current developments and trends in discrete mathematics and computer science.
- It is too long and verbose for a first-year course and may overwhelm some students.
- It does not provide enough visual aids such as diagrams, tables, and graphs to facilitate the understanding of complex concepts.
- It does not offer any online resources or supplementary materials to enhance the learning experience.

In conclusion, **Discrete Mathematical Structures with Applications to Computer Science** by J.P. Tremblay and R. Manohar is a classic textbook that covers the essential topics of discrete mathematics for computer science students. It is suitable for those who want to gain a deep and rigorous understanding of the subject and its applications. However, it may not be the best choice for those who prefer a more modern, concise, and interactive approach to learning discrete mathematics.
