# Corrosion Engineering: Principles and Solved Problems [2015] [PDF] - A Comprehensive Book Review
  
Corrosion engineering is a multidisciplinary field that deals with the prevention and control of corrosion in various environments and applications. Corrosion can cause significant damage to materials, structures, equipment, and human health, resulting in economic losses and environmental impacts. Therefore, understanding the fundamental principles of corrosion theory, passivity, and corrosion protection strategies is essential for engineers, scientists, and students who work with corrosive systems.

One of the most comprehensive and updated books on corrosion engineering is **Corrosion Engineering: Principles and Solved Problems**, written by Professor Branko N. Popov from the University of South Carolina. The book was published in 2015 by Elsevier and is available in both hardcover and eBook formats[^1^] [^2^]. The book covers corrosion engineering through an extensive theoretical description of the principles of corrosion theory, passivity and corrosion prevention strategies and design of corrosion protection systems[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. The book also includes solved corrosion case studies, corrosion analysis and solved corrosion problems to help the reader to understand the corrosion fundamental principles from thermodynamics and electrochemical kinetics, the mechanism that triggers the corrosion processes at the metal interface and how to control or inhibit the corrosion rates[^1^] [^2^].
  
The book consists of 14 chapters that cover the following topics:
  
- Chapter 1: Evaluation of Corrosion
- Chapter 2: Thermodynamics in the Electrochemical Reactions of Corrosion
- Chapter 3: Electrochemical Kinetics of Corrosion
- Chapter 4: Passivity
- Chapter 5: Polarization Methods for Corrosion Rate Determination
- Chapter 6: Corrosion Rate Determination by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy
- Chapter 7: Corrosion Rate Determination by Electrochemical Noise Analysis
- Chapter 8: Uniform Corrosion Attack
- Chapter 9: Galvanic Corrosion
- Chapter 10: Pitting Corrosion
- Chapter 11: Crevice Corrosion
- Chapter 12: Stress Corrosion Cracking
- Chapter 13: Intergranular Corrosion
- Chapter 14: Hydrogen Damage

The book is written in a clear and concise style, with numerous figures, tables, equations, examples, and references. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as researchers and practitioners who want to learn more about corrosion engineering. The book can also be used as a textbook for courses on corrosion engineering or as a reference book for professionals who deal with corrosion problems in their daily work.
