The film has been praised by critics for its realistic portrayal of Serbian youth and its sharp commentary on the social and political issues facing the country. The Hollywood Reporter called it "a warmer and more nuanced snapshot of contemporary youth" and "a engaging, funny, humane teen drama" [^1^]. Cineuropa described it as "a paradoxical mix of approaches" that "will make audiences think" [^2^]. The film also received positive feedback from the young audiences who voted for it at the Sarajevo Film Festival.
 
However, the film is not without flaws. Some critics have pointed out that the film relies too much on stereotypes and clichÃ©s, such as the gay character who is constantly harassed by his homophobic classmates, or the rebellious girl who is secretly pregnant. Others have argued that the film does not go deep enough into the psychological and emotional aspects of the characters, and that the ending is too optimistic and unrealistic. The film also faced some controversy for its depiction of violence, sex, and drugs among teenagers.
 
Overall, Pored mene is a bold and ambitious film that tries to capture the spirit and struggles of a generation that is often misunderstood and marginalized. It is a film that challenges the viewers to question their own prejudices and assumptions, and to empathize with the characters who are next to them.

The film features a talented cast of young actors who deliver convincing and natural performances. Hristina PopoviÄ, who plays the teacher Olja, is one of the most prominent actresses in Serbia, having starred in films such as Circles and The Parade. She brings a sense of dignity and compassion to her role, as well as a touch of vulnerability. Slaven DoÅ¡lo, who plays the flamboyant Lazar, is a rising star who has appeared in several TV shows and films, such as Panama and The Samurai in Autumn. He steals every scene he is in with his charisma and humor. Nikola GliÅ¡iÄ, who plays the macho Strahinja, is also a newcomer who has impressed critics and audiences with his physical presence and intensity. He manages to show some layers and complexity to his character, who is not just a bully but also a victim of his own insecurities.
 
The film also features some veteran actors who play supporting roles, such as Mirjana KaranoviÄ, Dragan MiÄanoviÄ, and Goran JevtiÄ. They add some weight and credibility to the film, as well as some comic relief. Mirjana KaranoviÄ plays Olja's mother, who is a former dissident and a staunch feminist. She has a strained relationship with her daughter, who she thinks is too soft and naive. Dragan MiÄanoviÄ plays Olja's husband UgljeÅ¡a, who is a controversial artist whose work provokes the ire of the nationalists. He tries to support his wife, but he also has his own problems and doubts. Goran JevtiÄ plays Olja's colleague Marko, who is a cynical and sarcastic teacher who does not care about his students or his job.
 
The film showcases the diversity and talent of Serbian cinema, which has been producing some quality films in recent years. The film also reflects the reality and challenges of Serbian society, which is still recovering from the wars and conflicts of the 1990s. The film offers a glimpse into the lives and dreams of the young people who are trying to find their place and voice in a changing world.
