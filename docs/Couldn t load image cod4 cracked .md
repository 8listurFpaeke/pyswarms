1. Verify the integrity of your game files. If you have the game on Steam, you can right-click on the game in your library, select Properties, then Local Files, and then Verify Integrity of Game Files. This will check if any of your game files are missing or damaged and replace them if necessary.
2. Update your graphics card drivers. Sometimes, outdated or incompatible drivers can cause issues with loading images in the game. You can check for updates on your graphics card manufacturer's website or use a tool like Driver Booster to automatically scan and update your drivers.
3. Copy the files from the Crack folder. If you have a cracked version of the game, you might need to copy some files from the Crack folder to the main folder of the game. To do this, go to your setup folder (DVD or CD), double-click on the Crack folder, then double-click on the main folder. You will see some files that you need to copy. Then go to your game folder and double-click on the main folder. You will see the same files but they are all of 0 kb size. Delete those files and paste the ones that you copied from the Crack folder.
