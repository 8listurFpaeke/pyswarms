## USB Port
 
The Targa Pna E3530n has a USB port that allows you to connect it to your computer. You can use your computer to download map data, save map data, and restore map data. This way, you can always have the latest maps and routes available on your device. You can also use your computer to download traffic updates from the map. These updates include reports of accidents, construction, and lane closures. By having this information, you can avoid traffic jams and save time and fuel.
 
## E-Ink Display
 
The Targa Pna E3530n has an e-ink display on the back of the unit. This display is an LCD, which means it does not require any backlighting. This makes it easy to read in any lighting condition, even in direct sunlight. The e-ink display also consumes less power than a conventional LCD, which means it can last longer on a single charge. You can use the e-ink display to view map information, navigate using the unit's maps, and view live traffic conditions. The e-ink display has a resolution of 800 x 600 pixels and can show up to 16 shades of gray.
 
## Traffic Updates
 
The Targa Pna E3530n can receive traffic updates from the map via the USB port. These updates are provided by a service called TMC (Traffic Message Channel). TMC is a digital radio service that broadcasts traffic information in real time. The Targa Pna E3530n can decode these signals and display them on the e-ink screen. You can also hear voice prompts that alert you of any traffic incidents or delays ahead. By using the traffic updates feature, you can plan your route more efficiently and avoid unnecessary detours.
