## DeltaMushToSkin: A Plugin for Smoothing Skinned Characters
 
DeltaMushToSkin is a plugin that allows you to apply the Delta Mush deformer to any skinned character and convert it to a Skin modifier. Delta Mush is a technique that smooths out deformations and preserves details without losing volume. It can be used to fix bad skinning, improve facial expressions, enhance muscle movements and more. With DeltaMushToSkin, you can easily transfer the Delta Mush effect to a Skin modifier, which is compatible with any game engine or renderer. You can also adjust the strength and radius of the effect, as well as exclude specific bones or vertices from the smoothing.
 
## SmoothBoolean: A Plugin for Creating Smooth Transitions between ProBoolean Meshes
 
SmoothBoolean is a plugin that allows you to create smooth transitions between ProBoolean meshes without spending hours on cleaning messy topologies. ProBoolean is a tool that lets you perform boolean operations on meshes, such as union, subtraction and intersection. However, it often results in complex and jagged edges that are hard to smooth or subdivide. SmoothBoolean solves this problem by applying a special modifier that blends the edges seamlessly and preserves the original shape of the meshes. You can also control the amount of smoothing, the curvature of the edges and the quality of the mesh.
 
## Weight Pro: A Plugin for Automatic and Fast Skin Modifier Weighting
 
Weight Pro is a plugin that allows you to automatically and quickly weight your skinned characters with a Skin modifier, no matter if the mesh has good or messy topology. It uses a GPU-based voxelization algorithm to calculate the shortest distances between bones and vertices, and assigns weights accordingly. It also lets you make adjustments during posing in real time, as well as clamp furthermost weights and copy bones settings on symmetrical objects. Weight Pro is a powerful and easy-to-use tool that can save you a lot of time and effort when skinning your characters.
