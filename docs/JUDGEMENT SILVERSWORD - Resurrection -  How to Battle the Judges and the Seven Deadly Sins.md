Judgement Silversword is the winner of the "WonderWitch" 2001 game development contest, and was released in 2004. It is one of the few shooting games designed for a handheld console, and it's also one of the best. You have to destroy enemies as quickly as possible to rack up a high multiplier, but your multiplier will drop quickly if you don't keep up the pace. You can use three different weapons to deal with different situations, and you have to dodge waves of bullets and enemies. Judgement Silversword is also the inspiration and predecessor to the gameplay ideas in Eschatos, another shmup by indie developer M-KAI.
 
Cardinal Sins is a score trial marathon that spans 7 different areas, each with a unique objective themed around the 7 Deadly Sins. You have to collect lives in Sloth, hoard enemy data in Greed, and avoid destruction at the hands of Wrath. Each area has its own rules and challenges, and you have to master them all to get an S rank in every trial. Cardinal Sins is an interesting twist on shoot 'em up gameplay that tests your skills and adaptability.
 
JUDGEMENT SILVERSWORD - Resurrection - is a faithful port of hard-to-find WonderSwan Color games that lets you play them on your PC. You can also enjoy Steam achievements and leaderboards. If you want to experience some classic shmup action with a modern twist, you can download JUDGEMENT SILVERSWORD - Resurrection - from Steam[^1^] or GameLoop[^3^]. You can also find more information about the games on their official website.

How to play JUDGEMENT SILVERSWORD - Resurrection -
 
In Judgement Silversword, you control a spaceship that can switch between three weapons: a wide shot, a narrow shot, and a sword. The wide shot covers a large area but has low power, the narrow shot is more focused and powerful but has less range, and the sword can destroy bullets and enemies in close proximity. You can also use a bomb to clear the screen of enemies and bullets, but you have a limited supply of them. You have to balance your weapons and bombs to survive the onslaught of enemies and bosses that will try to stop you.

In Cardinal Sins, you have to complete seven trials based on the Seven Deadly Sins: Pride, Envy, Wrath, Sloth, Greed, Gluttony, and Lust. Each trial has a different objective and gameplay mechanic that you have to master. For example, in Pride, you have to destroy enemies without getting hit or using bombs, in Envy, you have to collect items that match your color and avoid those that don't, and in Wrath, you have to avoid destroying enemies or they will explode and damage you. You have to score as high as possible in each trial to get a rank from F to S.
 
Both games have a simple but elegant pixel art style that captures the retro feel of the WonderSwan Color games. The music and sound effects are also catchy and fitting for the genre. The games are challenging but rewarding for shmup fans who enjoy mastering different gameplay modes and scoring systems.
