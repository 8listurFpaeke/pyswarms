# Nacrtna Geometrija: A Book Review
 
Nacrtna Geometrija (Descriptive Geometry) is a book that covers the basic concepts and methods of projecting and drawing spatial figures on a plane. It is intended for students of technical and biotechnical faculties, as well as anyone who wants to deepen their knowledge of this field. The book is written by Bahrudin Hrnjica, a professor at the University of BihaÄ in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 
The book is divided into seven chapters, each dealing with a different topic of descriptive geometry. The first chapter introduces the fundamental notions of geometry, such as geometric shapes, planar transformations, projection principles, basic constructions, complex curves and polygons. The second and third chapters explain the orthogonal projection on two and three planes, respectively, where the classical themes of descriptive geometry are discussed. The fourth chapter deals with geometric solids and surface curves, as well as their projections. The fifth and sixth chapters explore the projection on one plane, namely the dimensioned projection and axonometry. The last chapter presents the intersections and penetrations of geometric solids, which summarize all the previous chapters.

At the end of each chapter, there are a number of solved examples, as well as exercises for independent practice. The book is based on the lectures and exercises that the author has given for several years. It is written in a clear and concise style, with many illustrations and diagrams to facilitate understanding. The book also includes references to other sources of literature on descriptive geometry, such as [^1^], [^2^], [^3^] and .

Nacrtna Geometrija is a valuable resource for learning and teaching descriptive geometry. It offers a comprehensive and systematic presentation of the subject matter, with a balance between theory and practice. It can be used as a primary textbook for students of technical faculties, or as a supplementary material for anyone interested in this field.
  
Descriptive geometry is not only a theoretical discipline, but also a practical one. It has many applications in engineering, architecture, design and art. For example, descriptive geometry can help to design and analyze mechanisms, such as gears, cams, linkages and robots. It can also help to create and interpret technical drawings, such as orthographic projections, isometric views, perspective drawings and sections. Moreover, descriptive geometry can enhance the spatial visualization skills and creativity of students and professionals who deal with spatial problems.
 
Nacrtna Geometrija is a book that reflects the importance and relevance of descriptive geometry in various fields of science and technology. It offers a comprehensive and systematic presentation of the subject matter, with a balance between theory and practice. It can be used as a primary textbook for students of technical faculties, or as a supplementary material for anyone interested in this field.
