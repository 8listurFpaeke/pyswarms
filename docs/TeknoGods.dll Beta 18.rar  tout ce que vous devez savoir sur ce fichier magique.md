## Step 1: Download TeknoGods.dll Beta 18.rar
 
You can download TeknoGods.dll Beta 18.rar from the official website of TeknoGods.com[^1^]. The file size is about 3 MB and it contains two files: TeknoGods.dll and DLLLoad.exe. You will need both of them to use the tool.
 
## Step 2: Extract TeknoGods.dll Beta 18.rar
 
After downloading TeknoGods.dll Beta 18.rar, you need to extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You can extract it to any folder you want, but make sure it is not in the game directory. For example, you can extract it to C:\\DLLLoad.
 
## Step 3: Run DLLLoad.exe
 
Before running DLLLoad.exe, you need to run the game of your choice first. For example, if you want to play Lost Planet 2, run LP2Launcher.exe from the game folder. Then, run DLLLoad.exe from the folder where you extracted TeknoGods.dll Beta 18.rar. This should autoload the dll in the game memory. You will see a message saying "DLL Loaded" if it works.
 
## Step 4: Press F12
 
For most games, you need to press F12 twice: once in the lobby before joining a game and once after joining a game. This will prevent the game from crashing and enable online play. You will hear "Working" when it patches and "Transfer Complete" when you repatch. For Dawn of War II, you don't need to press F12 at all.
 
## Step 5: Enjoy playing online
 
Now you can enjoy playing online with your friends using virtual network software like Hamachi or Tunngle. You can use TeknoGods Helper[^1^] to find and join games easily. Have fun!
 
## Troubleshooting
 
If you encounter any errors or problems while using TeknoGods.dll Beta 18, here are some possible solutions:
 
- If DLLLoad.exe gives errors, make sure you have deleted teknogods.dll entry from App\_Init\_dlls in your registry. This is only needed if you used older versions of TeknoGods.dll.
- If the game freezes when you quit, go to task manager and kill it from there. Or press Home to crash the game to windows.
- If the game does not support your version, try using an older or newer version of TeknoGods.dll. You can find them on the official website[^1^].
- If you have any other questions or issues, please visit the official forum[^1^] and post your problem there. Include all log files and a detailed description of your problem.
